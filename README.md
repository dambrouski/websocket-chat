Websocket based app(Socket.io) chat, running with node.js and mongodb(mongoose) on the server.
Client side was built with backbone.js,require.js and text.js plugin for simple templating.

Make sure you have mongodb running. To start this app cd to the root directory and run node index.js.
Point your browser to localhost:3700.

For now this app supports:  chat with everybody, all users and messages would be persisted in mongodb. 

Enjoy :)
